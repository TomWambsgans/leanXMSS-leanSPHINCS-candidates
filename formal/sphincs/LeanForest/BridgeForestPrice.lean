/-! The forest price over multisets of disclosed kept views. A target view is covered when, in every
tree and both subtrees, each chain of the WOTS key it selects is disclosed at or below the position
it needs by a disclosed view at the same index. The cover indicator is monotone (it is not
supermodular: a second cover adds nothing). The fresh-digest price averages it over a uniform landed
digest. -/
